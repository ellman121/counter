# Counter

This app is a basic life counter app.  It allows for life totals, resource counters (such as Keys in Keyforge), resets to custom and sensible-default values, and a small selection of beautiful themes.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
